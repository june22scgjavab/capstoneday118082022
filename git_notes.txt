As I am doing the action of pushing the code for the first time.
I have to provide some commands.

Next two lines are for once only.
1. git config --global user.name "june22scgjavab" <Enter>
2. git config --global user.email "june22scgjavab@gmail.com" <Enter>
The below step is to ensure that everything specially the username and email setting is done correctly
git config --list



PART1
First we create a remote repo in the
github account

PART2
Managing the local repo
1) We created a folder
2) We right clicked over the folder and
  opened the git bash
3) We got a command prompt which is similar to
   unix or linux command prompt.
4) The first command which we should use to convey that this is the local repository
   git init
5) To add all the files and folders of the current project for staging.
   git add First.java
   git add *.java
   git add . ( . the content of the current folder and current folder which we have considered as local repo)
6) git commit -m "My first commit"  ( This will commit in the local repo)
7) We have to map to the remote repo
  git remote add origin <The repo path>
8) git push origin master<Open a dialog box for authentication>
9) Check the remote repo for the push content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)Create a folder called localrepo.
2)Within that folder , save a text file called hello.txt. With the content hello world!!!!!
3) Create a private repository with the name myremoterepository in github.
4) push the content of local repository in the remote repository called myremoterepository.
5) Made a change in the remote repository by opening the editor of github and make the text of the hello world as hello friends!!!!.
6) Commit the file in the github only.
7) Come back to the local repo and change the content of the hello.text as hi friends!!!!!.
8) Now try to push the changed content ... What you observe. 
9) You get an error because your remote content is not in synch with the local content.
  git pull origin master
10) Check the content of the file and make the required changes.
11) again commit and push and check whether push is with a success this time.
